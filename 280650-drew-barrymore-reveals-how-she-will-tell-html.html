However, she knows that she’ll have to uncover her past to her daughters one day.</p><p class=Zg>Everybody has a past they would like to forget when they’ve turned over a new leaf in life. Unfortunately, when you are a celebrity, it may be more challenging to put everything behind you.</p><p class=Zg>This is the case for Drew Barrymore, who had a colorful childhood and an even more chaotic time as a teenager. The Hollywood icon recently explained how she would ensure her daughters learn about her wild past.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Drew Barrymore turns to the audience after flashing host David Letterman during a taping of the Late Show with David Letterman , April 1995 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Barrymore was born into the industry with a family of actors to ease her into the spotlight. Consequently, she was in a commercial when she turned eleven months and was a movie star by seven.</p><p class=Zg>Unfortunately, the early exposure to stardom and freedom as a child put her on a dangerous path. She was addicted to drugs by the time she turned twelve, cut her wrists at thirteen, and was emancipated at fourteen.</p><p class=Zg>Barrymore has been candid with her fans about her life journey, including being the ultimate party girl at eight years old. She has even taken the time to <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-mother-locked-up-in-institution-interview>reflect</a> on some of her actions in past interviews:</p><p class=Zg>“I was probably chasing joy, but I don’t think it was the real joy.

She has explained many times that she does not intend to hide her truths away from her daughters.</p><p class=Zg>In fact, she recently <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.eonline.com/news/1305035/how-drew-barrymore-is-preparing-for-her-daughters-to-learn-about-her-wild-past?cmpid=social_instagram_bio%26source%3Dinstagram-enews%26medium%3Dlink-post">admitted</a> that she is already preparing her children for the day they find out about her past. The actress touched on this during an interview with “American Pie” star Jason Biggs.</p><p class=Zg>Barrymore revealed that she is constantly making her daughters aware that they will see a different side of her at some point. However, she also cuts herself some slack during these conversations by <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l96HotVSsVw">explaining</a>:</p><p class=Zg>​​ "Because that's the other thing—you don't know you're going to be a parent one day when you're figuring it all out.”</p><p class=Zg>Although dealing with her children holding her accountable for her past is stressful, <a class="zd d" href=#>Barrymore</a> still has wonderful things to say about motherhood. The actress expressed that motherhood is the most fulfilling experience for her.</p><p class=Zg>Barrymore shares daughters Olive and Frankie with her <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/drew-barrymore-i-was-very-dark-fearful-place-after-divorce-t125751>third</a> ex-husband, Will Kopelman.
