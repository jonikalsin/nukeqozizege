She shared about her life as a s*x trafficking victim. After Fousey got comfortable with her as the two shared kisses, they, later on, left the camera for a while before Fousey arrived and said he just joined the “mile high club”.</p><p>Fousey had been gaining popularity on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch </a>as he was doing an IRL subathon, where it had been 35 days he was streaming nonstop at the time. He recently sulked in controversy before this incident as he dropped the N-word whilst singing a rap song, live on stream.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>On August 6th during Fousey’s stream on Twitch, he was headed to Los Angeles from the airport. There as he was streaming he met a girl named Sarah who he instantly connected with at a bar. Later on, she began to confess and reveal her life stories as a victim of the s*x industry and even being inside a cult.</p><p>During all this Fousey was seen getting closer to her as he took her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram </a>ID, bought a meal for her, and even checked out a tattoo of hers close to her private body part (when the camera was kept away). He later on even shared a kiss with her twice as they started getting really comfortable with each other, constantly complimenting each other.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">xQc calls MMA fans “insecure losers” for claiming Jake Paul vs Nate Diaz boxing match rigged&nbsp;</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fousey-allegedly-took-advantage-of-a-vulnerable-drunk-women><strong>Fousey allegedly took advantage of a vulnerable drunk women</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/13-1024x576.jpg><p>Despite seemingly having a great on-screen relationship, things took a turn when the topics turned emotional. As Sarah shared her story, she burst into tears and so did Fousey. Following this Fousey told her to come off camera so he can tell her about his story. The two seemed to getting close to each other as they shared details, and later on, Fousey comes back to the camera and switches it around claiming he would go to the ‘convenience store’ to get things for Sarah.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FouseyTube has been cancelled for allegedly taking advantage of a drunk s*x trafficking victim.</p><p>Do you think he’s out of second chances? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p2PewzA6qE</a></p>— DramaAlert (@DramaAlert) <a href=#>August 7, 2023</a></figure><p>As they return Fousey with a whole new vibrant face smiles at the camera and boasts “I joined the mile-high club. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I should not have shared that.” He immediately starts retracing his words as he notices a wave of feedback on his chat server. “‘Im sorry, I’m sorry. I’m lying, by the way, it was a joke. It’s a joke, a huge joke…. You got pranked by FouseyTube.”</p><p>But it seemed too late, as Fousey had seemingly messed up. The chat made sure to let him know as he slowly started getting emotional later on in the stream. He even said “I spent my whole career pretending to be a good person. What can I do to make people like me? I’m not a good person. I’m not a good person…. And I got exposed tonight. I’m not a good person.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fouseytube </a>since then has been banned on Twitch. The whole incident was messy as Sarah was seemingly drunk from the beginning of the interaction. Despite Fousey knowing that his consciousness did not arrive. He has recently taken to Twitter to announce he will be taking a break as he needs ‘therapy’. Many like xQc have even reacted to this situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Fousey has been through many controversies throughout his career. With a long absence from his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube </a>career, and after going through depression, he has now sought validation on Twitch. He is reportedly in the signing for a streaming contract with Kick. However, now fans are speculating whether Kick would like to sign such a controversial creator to their platform or not.</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZKysopqurrXNoGScp52iwq%2B107JknJmemLKtv4ytrqKsk516tMDRnpimnaJis7DB0p6wra2SmsBuss6rZK2Zm567qHnAna2apqSWtKZ5zp9kmmWUp8Kvt4ysr2asopazp7XCpKCnn12rtqTAyKZm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-dion-jordan-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-promising-nfl-player.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Dion Jordan?
