Law enforcement stopped the truck by throwing spikes, which then led to a foot chase, sources tell ABC13.</p><p>Lopez was then shot and killed by authorities. No officers were injured.</p><p>Officials believe Lopez to be connected to these murders. Lopez is among Texas’ top 10 most wanted fugitives, according to DPS.</p><p>This comes three days after the Texas Department of Criminal Justice released new photos of the escaped inmate, Gonzalo Lopez.</p><p>The 46-year-old escaped from a prison bus on May 12 near Centerville. He hasn’t been seen since.</p><p>In 1996, Lopez was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault and received two eight-year sentences. In 2006, he was convicted of capital murder and aggravated kidnapping in Hidalgo County and was sentenced to life in prison, according to the TDCJ.</p><p>Additionally, he received a second life sentence after he was convicted of attempted capital murder in Webb County in 2007.</p><p>Officials say Lopez is affiliated with the Mexican Mafia and has ties to the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio.</p><p>A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his capture: The Texas Department of Public Safety is offering $35,000, U.S. Marshals are offering $10,000 and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is offering $5,000.</p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11908923_053022-ktrk-tattoos-escapted-inmate-img.jpg data-imagewarning=Off style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The new photos show tattoos across Lopez’s chest, back and arms.</p><p>The word “Gonzo” is tattooed across his abdomen, while his back says “Mexican” across the top, according to officials.</p><p>Officials say Lopez was being transported from the Hughes Unit in Gatesville to the Estelle Unit in Huntsville for a medical appointment when he escaped.</p><p><b>RELATED: New photos released as search for escaped Texas inmate who stole and crashed prison bus continues</b></p><p>The TDCJ said due to his criminal history and restrictive housing status, Lopez was being transported in a separate, caged area of the bus, designed for high-risk inmates.</p><p>During the transport, Lopez reportedly got out of his restraints, cut through the expanded metal and crawled out of the bottom of the cage.</p><p>That’s when law enforcement officials say he attacked the bus driver.</p><p>The officer reportedly stopped the bus and engaged in an altercation with Lopez. The two of them eventually exited the bus.</p><p>Officials said a second officer exited the rear door of the bus and tried to approach Lopez.</p><p><b>ORIGINAL REPORT: Authorities looking for escaped inmate who stole and crashed bus near Centerville</b></p><p>However, Lopez reportedly reentered the bus and began driving away.</p><p>The two officers fired shots at the inmate, which ultimately disabled the bus when a bullet struck a rear tire.</p><p>The bus then traveled a short distance and left the roadway before Lopez got out and ran into the woods off Highway 7 in Leon County, officials said.</p><p>Leon County is roughly 116 miles north of Houston.</p><p>Lopez is 6 feet tall, 185 pounds and heavily tattooed, and was last seen wearing white clothing.</p><p>Anyone with information on his location should call TDCJ OIG Crime Stoppers at 1-800-832-8477 or 936-437-5171.
