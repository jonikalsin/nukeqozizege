Richard was a prosecutor, while Rhea was a homemaker and took care of the children. The commentator had a pleasant upbringing and had grown up in a caring family. He was the oldest of four brothers.</p><p>Greg had a younger brother named Bryant Gumbel and two younger sisters named Renee Gumbel-Farrahi and Rhonda Gumbel-Thomas. Bryant is also a sports presenter and a commentator, much like his older brother. He’s still very notable for partnering with well-known networks including NBC and CBS. In addition, he has a large following and has won numerous Emmy awards for his outstanding contribution to the sporting community. Bryant has even announced on the NFL Network and has also appeared in movies like The Weather Man and Seinfield. He also caught media attention when he lost about 55 pounds in seven months.</p><p>While he was born in Louisiana, Bryant and his siblings were raised on the south side of Chicago. There he attended a Catholic school called the De La Salle Institute. As a student at the institute, he was actively involved in sports. In particular, the oldest Gumbel was interested in baseball.</p><p>After graduating from high school, he attended Loras University in Iowa, where he played baseball. He was a brilliant student and graduated from college with a degree in English.</p><h2><span id=Greg_Gumbel_Age_Height_and_Weight>Greg Gumbel&nbsp; Age, Height, and Weight</span></h2><p>The exceptional broadcaster was 75 years old from 2021.

At the same time, his younger brother Bryant was serving as a sportscaster to NBC-owned and operated television station KNBC in Los Angeles.</p><p>Thereupon, he informed Greg about an audition for a sports announcer in another NBC-owned-and-operated television station, WMAQ-TV in Chicago. The former baseball player did quite well in the audition, and the TV station eventually offered him the job. Furthermore, he worked there for seven years before working at other prominent networks. The TV host has worked at MSG, ESPN, and in a radio station operated by Entercom, WFAN. Moreover, he was an announcer in SportsCenter and play-by-play commentator in early NBA games. Likewise, he was also a backup announcer for New York Knicks broadcasts and host of pregame and postgame shows for New York Yankees.</p><p>Thereafter in 1988, he started his CBS journey as a part-time NFL announcer. Then, gradually the broadcaster started announcing college basketball and The NFL Today show with former football player turned broadcaster Terry Bradshaw.</p><p>Moreover, he covered MLB, college football, and NASCAR Cup Series Daytona 500. Above all, the host was also a play-by-play announcer for NBA, MLB, American League Championship Series, and College World Series baseball. Besides that, in 1994, he was an evening time anchor for Winter Olympic Games held in Lillehammer, Norway. Furthermore, the sportscaster co-anchored the 1992 Winter Olympics that took place in France. After the CBS network lost NFL and MLB broadcasting contracts, he joined NBC in 1994.

Then, during the 2004 NFL season, he took over as the host of The NFL Today, trading places with announcer Jim Natz. However, after the 2005 season, he was replaced by sportscaster James Brown. Brown is not an unfamiliar face in CBS and The NFL Today. He has worked with famous players and broadcasters like Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Jimmy Jhonson.</p><p>Following the replacement, he became the #2 play-by-play man after returning to broadcasting.
