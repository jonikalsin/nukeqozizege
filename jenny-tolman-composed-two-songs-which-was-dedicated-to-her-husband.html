He was just a coworker who had recently become a dear buddy.&nbsp;However, when the news reached Tolman, she experienced what she says was an epiphany. She was in love.</p><h2>Dave Brainard Was Brutally Assaulted</h2><p>It was September 2015, and the Grammy-nominated producer was with a pal somewhere in Nashville when they were both savagely beaten and left for dead.&nbsp;Thankfully, they made it to the hospital.&nbsp;According to an exclusive People article, Brainard suffered a fractured jaw, a mouthful of smashed teeth, and many facial lacerations. Tolman learned the news not long after.</p><p>“When you get that kind of news about someone, it validates everything you feel for that person,” she told the site. “It was a revelation for me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jenny-Tolman-2.jpg alt="Jenny Tolman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It felt like, ‘Oh my God, I’m in love with this guy, and someone has wounded him, and I need to be with him.’ That’s when I understood he wasn’t simply a nice buddy. He was my person.</p><h2>Jenny Tolman Composed Songs for Injured Dave Brainard</h2><p>The country singer also stated that she created two songs for Brainard and mailed them to him when he was in the hospital.&nbsp;“I remember him sending me a text message essentially saying, ‘This is so gorgeous’ and ‘Gosh, you are so beautiful,'” she said. “That’s a text I clung to.” Brainard was still receiving dental operations as a consequence of the September 2015 assault at the time of this interview in 2021. So you’re aware that the assault was severe.&nbsp;Ironically, the dreadful night that might have permanently divided Tolman and Brainard was the night that drew them even closer together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jenny-Tolman-3.jpg alt="Jenny Tolman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Dave Brainard’s Confession of Love</h2><p>A few months had gone by since that sad occurrence, and the pair, still friends, went out to supper in January 2016.&nbsp;“It had just begun snowing in Nashville that night, and we had gone to supper, but I wasn’t 21 yet, so we couldn’t go to a bar,” the singer recounted.&nbsp;When the producer confessed his feelings, he was driving.</p><p>“He was like, ‘Please know that this was never my goal, and I don’t know how this occurred, but I believe I am in love with you,’ and I responded, ‘I’m in love with you,'” Tolman revealed.&nbsp;The night concluded at Brainard’s place, and the pair have been together ever since.</p><h2>Dave Brainard and Jenny Tolman Have Married</h2><p>After four years of dating, Brainard dropped down on one knee and asked Tolman to marry him. Bernard proposed on October 28, 2020, while hiking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.&nbsp;“The strange thing is that a professional photographer happened to be hiking and witnessed the proposal and began capturing photographs of us,” the vocalist said.&nbsp;On March 19, 2022, the pair would exchange vows as husband and wife after over a year and a half of dating.&nbsp;“Perfect is an understatement,” the spouse remarked of the wedding.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqaernq1u8ummKdlk6S6sbvSnptmrKekerS7zaCqZq%2BYnrCpedaaqmaclZm2pK3TnptmrJ9itaa%2BjKGsrJqRo7Fw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-this-old-man-came-rolling-home-by-the-wiggles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Meaning Behind The Song: This Old Man Came Rolling Home by The Wiggles">&larr;
