In 2022 also we have 12 talented casts who will be competing against each other to win the title. One of the contestants is Josh Duarte.</p><p>This Josh Duarte Bio covers information on his girlfriend, height, and his appearance on the show, and his castmate.</p><h3><strong>Josh Duarte On The Great Pottery Throw Down</strong></h3><p>Josh Duarte is one of the 12 participants who will compete in Channel 4’s The Great Pottery Throw Down in 2022.</p><p>The show first aired in 2015 and received a lot of positive feedback from viewers. It’s now in its sixth season, and you’ll meet judges Keith Brymer Jones and Rich Miller, as well as hosts Siobhán McSweeney and Ellie Taylor. Besides the returning hosts and judges you’ll also meet 12 full-time/part-time pottery enthusiasts who have something to show to the world.</p><p>AJ Simpson, Anna McGurn, Cellan, <a href=#>Bill Thomas</a>, <a href=#>Jenny Cobb</a>, Christine Cherry, Lucinda Lovesey, Miles Johnson, Nick Robatto, <a href=#>Tom Demeranville</a>, and Zahra Jabir will all appear alongside Josh.</p><p>The show’s first episode was released on 2 January 2022 on Channel 4. Rose Schmits is the pottery technician for The Great Pottery Throw Down 2022, after taking over from Rich Miller last year.
