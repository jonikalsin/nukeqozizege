The professional Ghanaian-American wrestler has been in the SmackDown since 2006. And from the better half of his wrestling career, Kofi always supported his wife, <strong>Kori Campfield.</strong></p><p>Today, we will be focusing more on Kori and her life as the wife of a celebrity wrestler. But, of course, we all know that Kofi is a big name in the wrestling world and the entertainment industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kori-002.jpg><p>Since her husband’s fame often overshadows kori, Mrs. Kingston is forgotten by many. Hence, we will make sure to reveal any information there is about her.</p><h2>Kori Campfield: Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Kori Campfield</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>April 21, 1982</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Accra, Ghana</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Known as</strong></td><td>Kori Campfield</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>Ghanaian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>African</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>41 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>Updating Soon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>Updating Soon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Celebrity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Famous As</strong></td><td>Wife of Kofi Kingston</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Kofi Kingston</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Two</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$100k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch of Kofi Kingston</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Action Figure</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Funko Pop</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=#>Facebook</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Who is Kori Campfield? What is her nationality?</h2><p>For those who want to know, Kori Campfield, like most celebrity wife came to fame after her marriage to WWE star Kofi Kingston. The beloved wife Kori was born in Accra, Ghana, before she moved to the states, aka the land of dreams.</p><p>Since she spent most of her time on another continent, there are not many details on her childhood. Some standard information like the name of her parents, their profession, and whereabouts are still missing.</p><p>Likewise, the same is the case when it comes to her siblings as well. Not to mention, Kori’s academic qualifications are also not known. Nonetheless, Campfield must be an educated person.</p><p>Other than that, Kori’s nationality is Ghanian, and as for her ethnic background, she is African.</p><h2>How old is Kori? |&nbsp; Age and Height</h2><p>On multiple occasions, we have seen Kofi accompanied by his beautiful wife, Kori Campfield. With her slim yet curvy figure, Kori looked stunning in every one of her public appearances. Along with that, her long dark brown hair and a pair of coffee-colored eyes enhanced Kori’s beauty.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Manning Kellerman Age, Brother, Net Worth, Husband, Career, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Likewise, judging by her appearance alone, it is hard to believe Campfield is already in her late 30s. Yes, this stunning diva is 38 years old as of now. She was born on April 21, 1982, where her zodiac sign happens to be Taurus.</p><p>From what we know, the people under this sign are known for their stubbornness, passion, and determination. Other than this, she has not revealed her body measurements like her height and weight. We will make sure to update you on those soon.</p><h2>What is Kofi Kingston Net Worth? How much does Kori Campfield earn in a year?</h2><p>When it comes to Kori, most parts of her life and career have been nothing but a mystery. Aside from her education and family, the celebrity wife has kept her career out of media attention. Hence, it is hard to pinpoint her profession.</p><p>However, some sources claim that this beloved WWE wife has earned a net worth of <strong>$100k</strong>. So, where does the money come from? No clue. But for now, the numbers are there.</p><p>Meanwhile, we know exactly where and how her husband, Kofi Kingston, gets his pay. As of now, the WWE superstar has accumulated a net worth of <strong>$3 million.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Other than his worth, the Ghanaian-American wrestler earns <strong>$500k</strong> from his salary alone. As we all know, Kofi is a WWE superstar and has been in this field since the beginning of 2006.</p><h2>What is Kori Campfield’s job? | Professional Career</h2><p>As mentioned above, there is no information or details giving insights into Kori’s profession and career. Just like her childhood, education, and life, the information is practically non-existent.</p><p>Despite the absence of information, it has not stopped people from making various speculations. For example, many sources claim, the celebrity wife, Kori, might be a housewife at the moment, tending after their two beloved sons.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tammy Bradshaw Age, Husband, Daughters, Philanthropy, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>However, Campfield has made a few television appearances where she is seen supporting her husband.</p><p>Since she is the wife of one of the famous WWE wrestlers, Kofi Kingston, it is hard to run from media attention and paparazzi. Still, Kori has managed to stay low profile and keep her family from any further media attention.</p><h2>Meet the wife of WWE superstar Kofi Kingston- Marriage and Children</h2><p>Now, talking about their relationship, Kofi and Kori are a married couple who tied the knot sometime in 2010. But, unfortunately, very little information is shared when it comes to their relationship, both before and after the marriage.</p><p>But some speculate the two must have known each other for a long time. Besides that, they had a beautiful engagement ceremony before tying the knots.</p><p>Nonetheless, just like other things, their wedding took place in an intimate manner where only their close family and friends attended. Fast forward to today, the couple is parents to two beautiful children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kori-001.jpg><p>Similarly, Kori gave birth to their first child, a son in 2013 who was named<strong> Khi</strong>. And later, in April 2016, Campfield welcomed their second child, also a son, called <strong>Orion</strong>. But, as expected from Kori, aside from their names, other details are barely there out in public.</p><p>But it seems, Kori like any other celebrity and wrestling personalities are active on social media- especially Facebook.</p><p>From there, we got some details of her personal life, like how the small family of four resides in their house in Tampa, Florida.</p><p>Moreover, Kori is also friends with other wrestling names such as <strong>Santino Marella</strong> and <strong>Natalie “Natalya” Neidhart</strong>. Funny enough, her account is nothing when it comes to her husband, who is far from active.</p><h2>Kofi Kingston | WWE Career</h2><p>Talking about the man of the hour and beloved husband, Kofi Kingston is a renowned professional wrestler. The Ghanaian-American is signed to WWE and performs actively under the SmackDown brand.</p><p>Sadly, following his back injury, the King is currently inactive and has to make any official comeback announcement.</p><p>Born as <strong>Kofi Nahaje Sarkodie-Mensah</strong>, Kofi Kingston was born to his parents, <strong>Kwasi</strong> and <strong>Elizabeth Sarkodie-Mensah</strong>. Kofi moved to the states with his family, including his brother, <strong>Kwame</strong>, and <strong>Nana Akua.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Likewise, despite opting to pursue a wrestling career, Kingston is a degree holder. Yes, the famed wrestle graduated from Winchester High School and later went to Boston College.</p><p>However, it was right after his college graduation that King focused on pursuing his career in wrestling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kori-003.jpeg><p>Not to mention, soon, he made a name as<strong> Kofi Nahaje Kingston</strong> as he began performing on the New England independent circuit as a Jamaican wrestler.</p><p>With his talent and knack for entertainment, WWE(World Wrestling Entertainment) signed Kofi in September 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, the wrestler used the same Jamaican character he had in the independent circuit. Later on, the company dropped the character and his accent, but Kofi still kept his name Kofi Kingston amidst all the changes.</p><h3>Rise to Prominence</h3><p>During his wrestling career, Kofi Kingston mostly participated in the mid-card singles scene of the WWE. He was a four-time Intercontinental Champion and also grabbed the US Championship three times.</p><p>Then in 2014, young Kofi joined his first group, The New Day, and participated in the Tag team Champions.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Samantha Rotunda Age, Height, Family, Husband, Divorce, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Similarly, the trio also held the record for being the longest Tag Team Championship in history from August 2015 to December 2016.</p><p>He finally got the opportunity to participate in “WrestleMania 35.” And after defeating <strong>Daniel Bryan</strong>, he even became one; Kingston’s first world titles in the company.</p><h3>Achievements and Other Ventures</h3><p>Over his fourteen years of wrestling career, Kofi Kingston has achieved fame and many championships to prove his worth.

Aside from that, the WWE star also guest-starred in an episode of Disney XD‘s karate sitcom Kickin’ It back in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Four years later, Kingston appeared in another show called Let’s Make a Deal with his New Day teammates, which was Christmas Family themed.

Never Be It back in 2017. He wrote the book with his fellow New Day members<strong> Big E</strong> and Xavier Woods.</p><h2>Kori Campfield | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Talking about her social account, Kori is active on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, but sadly, her account is private and not for outsiders to peek at.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><ul><li>I am living proof that if you work hard enough, you will be able to achieve anything, and I take a lot of pride in what I have achieved.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s so inspiring to be able to look a child in the eyes and just shake their hands and see the disbelief that this is actually happening.&nbsp;</li><li>It is one thing to tell people in theory that you can be whatever you want to be, but it is another thing to tell someone that they can be whatever they wanted to be because somebody that is just like you did it.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Kori Campfield | FAQs</h2><h3>Is Kofi Kingston still married?</h3><p>Yes, the fighter is still married to Kori Campfield.&nbsp;</p><h3>Was Kofi born in the United States of America?&nbsp;</h3><p>No, Kingston was born in Ghana and later on moved to the States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC3zqugZpuRor2ntcSlm2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./223278-ramona-singer-once-caught-her-ex-husband-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ramona Singer Once Caught Her Ex-husband on a Call with His Mistress  Look Back at the Drama">&larr;
