Lucie Arnaz has earned her substantial net worth through appearances on TV and film, as well as in musicals on stage. Lucie comes from a family of actors, being the daughter of the famous actress Lucille Ball and actor-musician Desi Arnaz. Her brother, Desi Arnaz, Jr., has also pursued a career in acting. Lucie Arnaz has been active in the industry since 1968 and continues to be a prominent figure, which explains her impressive net worth.</p><h3>Lucie Arnaz Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p>Lucie Arnaz was born in Los Angeles in 1951 and was raised there. Given her family background in acting, it was natural for her to follow suit. She made her on-screen debut in the famous show “I Love Lucy,” which featured both her parents. However, Lucie’s role in the show was minimal, and her part in another of her mother’s shows, “The Lucy Show,” was also small. “Here’s Lucy,” which aired from 1968 to 1974, marked a significant achievement for Lucie Arnaz. In this show, Lucie’s mother, Lucille Ball, played the main role, and the young Lucie portrayed her daughter Kim Carter.</p><p>After “The Lucy Show,” Lucie Arnaz shifted away from family-related projects and began to carve her own path, thus earning her net worth independently. Her first significant role was in the 1975 production, “Who is the Black Dahlia,” where Lucie portrayed the real-life murder victim Elisabeth Short. Later, in 1978, Lucie appeared in an episode of the popular TV series “Fantasy Island.” Although her own TV show, “The Lucie Arnaz Show,” which aired in 1985, did not attain much success, Lucie continued to work in television and appeared on well-known TV series such as “Murder She Wrote,” “Sons and Daughters,” and “Law and Order,” among others.</p><p>Lucie Arnaz expanded her popularity and net worth by venturing into the world of cinema. One of her most notable performances earned her a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. The role was in the 1980 remake of the 1927 hit movie “The Jazz Singer,” where Lucie appeared alongside renowned actor Laurence Olivier and singer Neil Diamond.</p><p>Another significant source of Lucie Arnaz’s net worth is musical theater. She began her theater career in the late ’70s, and one of her early roles was in the main role in Long Island’s Jones Beach Theater’s production of “Annie Get Your Gun.” A year later, she made her Broadway debut in the musical “They’re Playing Our Song.” Since then, she has been involved in numerous musicals and has received several awards, including the Theatre World Award and Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.</p><p>Lucie is also recognized for her contributions beyond acting. One of her notable endeavors included running the Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Center.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lucie Arnaz</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 17, 1951</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 9 in (1.77 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Film Producer, Singer, Dancer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Immaculate Heart High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Laurence Luckinbill (m. 1980), Phil Vandervort (m. 1971–1977)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Katharine Luckinbill, Joseph Luckinbill, Simon Luckinbill</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Desi Arnaz, Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Lucie Desiree Arnaz, Lucie Désirée Arnaz</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td><a href=#>http://www.facebook.com/luciearnazofficial</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td><a href=#>http://www.instagram.com/luciearnazofficial</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td><a href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036109</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Theatre World Award, Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Programs</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Who is the Black Dahlia” (1975), “Fantasy Island” (1978), “Murder She Wrote” (1988), “Sons and Daughters” (1991), and “Law and Order” (2003)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Here’s Lucy” (1968-1974), “The Lucie Arnaz Show” (1985), The Lucy Show (1962-1963)</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td>Here’s Lucy (1968)</td><td>$25,200 (1970)</td></tr><tr><td>Here’s Lucy (1968)</td><td>$20,400 (1969)</td></tr><tr><td>Here’s Lucy (1968)</td><td>$17,600 (1968)</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Everybody has a unique, interesting story to tell. I think what people can take away from this is that their story isn’t any less valuable than mine, or my mother’s. And because she had fame, that did not make her life that much easier or luckier. She had lots of perks. I doubt she would have traded what she had. But it wasn’t all that easy. A lot is expected of people who have that kind of fame. It’s a lot to carry around. It changes your life significantly. And not everybody is ready for that.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>[on whether her mother, Lucille Ball, considered herself a feminist] She would never have said that about herself. I think it ended up feeling like that to other women – “Look at her, she had the nerve to be that character on television, who wanted to do more than just be a housewife.” But, in fact, Lucy Ricardo never really wanted it bad enough to go get it. It just made for good comedy. My mother gets a lot of credit for being the first-woman-this and the first-woman-that. But I remember her saying, “Oh God, I never gave it a second thought.”.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>[on her father, Desi Arnaz] He was big enough and smart enough – as a producer, as a performer – to allow them to make fun of his mild accent. When, in reality, anybody with half-a-brain would be congratulating this person who now speaks two languages, fluently.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>[on performing onstage with Tommy Tune in “My One and Only”] I really loved it. It was a huge dancing show. I like to challenge myself. I don’t know what that’s about, probably proving that I’m not just Lucille Ball’s daughter, that I can actually get up and do something once in awhile. I would throw myself into these crazy situations. That was one of the best apprenticeships I could ever have as a dancer.</td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>She was awarded the 1978 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Distinguished Performance in a Musical for “A They’re Playing Our Song” at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Lucie weighed 3.345376 kilos or 7 lbs 6 oz at birth according to the birth announcement in the milestones column of Time magazine’s July 30, 1951 issue.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>She was supposed to play Betty Rizzo, but Lucille Ball objected when she learned the producers wanted her daughter to screen test for the role. Supposedly, she called up and said, “I used to own that studio; my daughter’s not doing a screen test!”. Olivia Newton-John on the other hand, insisted on a screen test for the role of Sandra Dee. She was concerned that she did not have the acting skills and that she would look too old to be a high school student. The screen test would allay those fears. She got the role that had originally been meant for Susan Dey who was Laurie Partridge on The Partridge Family (1970), which she turned down on her manager’s advice.</td></tr><p><br></p></tbody></table><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmijrpuZmnqivs2asWamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maribel-guardia-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maribel Guardia Net Worth - Pulptastic">&larr;
