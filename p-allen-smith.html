Allen said:</p><p><strong>“He had, throughout his life, this fascination with things that were very useful and functional and practical, and at the same time beautiful.”</strong></p><p>He later added:</p><p><strong>“He really saw Monticello as that — he saw it as what was described in the 18th century as a Ferme Ornée.” Ferme Ornée is French for “an ornamental farm.”</strong></p><p>Smith attended Hendrix College and received a Rotary International Scholarship to study garden history and design at the University of Manchester in England.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-26958 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/P.-Allen-Smith-wife.jpg.webp alt="P.

That’s when the spaces really come to life.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Beyond the flower gardens are orchards filled with stone fruit, blueberries, and heritage apple trees, a bluebird trail, a one-acre vegetable garden, a daffodil hill that overflows with more than 300,000 daffodils blooming every spring.</p><p>Allen said during an interview:</p><p><strong>“It was this concept of ferme ornée that influenced my layout of Moss Mountain, in which the farm is both functional and arranged in outdoor ‘rooms’ that display a mix of annuals, herbs, perennials, roses, shrubs, and ornamental grasses.”</strong></p><p>Smith also has Garden Home – a 1904 Colonial Revival cottage which is surrounded by a series of garden rooms designed by Allen.</p><p>He purchased the house for 1 US dollar and relocated it to a 1,400 m2 (15,000-square-foot) vacant lot.</p><p><strong>READ MORE: </strong><a href=#>Who is Jason Hawk’s wife?</a></p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-80019 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/who-is-p-allen-smiths-life-partner.jpg.webp alt="who is p allen smith's life partner" width=1200 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/who-is-p-allen-smiths-life-partner.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-80019 class=wp-caption-text>Olivier Giugni, Sydney Shuman, P.
