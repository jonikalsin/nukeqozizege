The Emmy Award-winning actress and her 15-year-old daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>matched in gorgeous</a> Gucci dresses as they walked the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Oscars red carpet</a> on March 12, 2023. As seen below, Salma rocked a fully sequined halter neck gown that fit her curves like a glove. Her daughter donned a sweet and strapless fit and flare dress. Salma previously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brought her daughter</a> to the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Eternals&nbsp;</a>in Oct. 2021. The then-14-year-old looked just like a younger version of her mom, as they posed for photos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/salma-hayek-valentina-oscars-2023-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Prior to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Salma enjoyed an incredibly accomplished career in movies and TV. Salma has starred in comedies like 30 Rock&nbsp;and&nbsp;Grown-Ups, but she’s also taken on plenty of serious dramas as well, like when she played renowned artist&nbsp;<strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> in the 2002 movie&nbsp;Frida, which earned her an Academy Award nomination. Salma had Valentina in 2007, when she was engaged to her now-husband&nbsp;<strong>François-Henri Pinault</strong>, 60. Learn everything there is to know about their beautiful daughter below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Salma-Hayek-Daughter-Valentina-embed-1.jpg><h2>Valentina Comes From Money</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Valentina’s mom may be used to the spotlight, her dad is also incredibly notable as a French businessman. François-Henri and Salma have been married since 2009, but they had Valentina together in 2007. François-Henri comes from a very successful family. His dad is billionaire <strong>François Pinault</strong>, and he founded the luxury goods company Kering, which owns major brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. François-Henri took over the company as CEO in 2005. He’s also the president of Groupe Artémis, which is a holding company.</p><h2>Valentina Has Three Half-Siblings</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before François-Henri got together with Salma, he was married to a woman named <strong>Dorothée Lepère</strong> from 1996 to 2004. They shared a son named <strong>François</strong> who was born in 1998, and a daughter, <strong>Mathilde</strong>, who they welcomed in 2001. He also has another son, <strong>Augustin James</strong>, born in 2006, from his relationship with Canadian model <strong>Linda Evangelista.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Salma Mostly Keeps Valentina’s Life Private</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Salma has kept her daughter out of the limelight for the most part. Other than the Eternals red carpet, Salma would occasionally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post photos</a> of the girl to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. For instance, the Desperado actress shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a touching tribute</a>&nbsp;to Valentina in Sept. 2021 to celebrate her 14th birthday. “Blessed be the day you came into my life to shine your radiant light,” she wrote. “Thank you for being you!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Salma-Hayek-Daughter-Valentina-embed-2.jpg><h2>Valentina Doesn’t Always Watch Her Mom’s Films</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Valentina seemed excited to see her mom’s performance in Eternals, the actress admitted that her daughter usually doesn’t watch her movies in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 2021 interview</a> with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a> to discuss her part in The Hitman’s Bodyguard’s Wife, which Valentina did see with her friends. “She insisted on this one. She never wants to see my stuff, but she insisted on watching this one and to go with her friends. I was really nervous and embarrassed. I said, ‘Don’t bring your friends. I’m going to really embarrass you.’ She’s like, ‘You embarrass me all the time, every day. What’s going to be different?'” Selma recalled.&nbsp; The actress’s fears amounted to nothing, as the flick seemed to be a hit with Valentina and her friends. “They loved it, she says, ‘Mom, I understand it’s not you. It’s the character.’ I was quite impressed with that,” she said.</p><h2>Salma Has A Lot In Common With Valentina</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Salma has opened up about parenting her daughter on occasion as well. She revealed that having Valentina at a slightly older age was a good decision in a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Town And Country</a>. “I think I’m a better mother because I had her later,” she told the magazine. “But I do get tired. I’m not going to lie.” In the same interview, she also described her daughter as “very creative, very smart, very funny, and very willful.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Kao6aZXZ2uurHKZpuarZedwaa%2BjG1sb2thbYVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rebel-moon-cast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebel Moon Full Cast List: Look Into Stars Net Worth">&larr;
