The singer-emotional songwriter’s original song, which moved the judges to tears, was inspired by her struggles.</h3><p>At 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, July 19, 2022, her audition was broadcast on NBC. The excellent applicant was one of many featured in Episode 8.</p><p>The AGT contestant admitted on stage that she had speech problems, which made life very tough for her. But until she started performing, there was no indication that she had a speech problem.</p><p>Simon Cowell, Sofia Vergara, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, the judges, and the live audience were all taken aback by this, as well as the crowd’s fervent applause after witnessing her talent.</p><p>As soon as Amanda entered the room and was introduced, the audience and viewers at home could immediately tell that she had a speech problem.</p><p>But what was amazing was how confident she remained during the contestant’s introduction. The 19-year-old native of Connecticut admitted to having a speech impediment and talked about the challenges she had growing up. She remarked:</p><p>“There was no doubt that it caused me to feel bashful and cover-up. But I’ve found that I don’t stutter when I sing.</p><p>The AGT contestant then declared that she had chosen to perform her song about the challenges she had encountered. The artist asserted that she would not change her history even if she could because it shaped who she is today.</p><p>Standing ovations were given to Amanda after her song astounded the judges and the audience. Both the live audience and television viewers were moved by the judges’ appreciation for her tenacity and bravery. The vocalist was then carried on to the following phase.</p><h2>Bio of Amanda Mammana</h2><p>She describes herself as a “multi-talented free spirit” on her website. When Amanda was ten years old, she struggled with her speaking. Her diagnosis had a significant negative impact on her outgoing personality.</p><p>She battled with uncertainties but found solace in music when she started playing the guitar, and it eventually became her “haven.” The AGT contestant worked on singing and playing the guitar simultaneously until she realized she wasn’t stuttering.</p><p>Amanda joined the praise band at her school when she was in the seventh grade. A year later, she joined the worship band at her church. She felt emancipated by singing and sharing her voice with others.</p><p>As she grew older, Amanda, on the other hand, battled apprehension and self-doubt. She was unable to explain herself because she was embarrassed by the way she spoke.</p><p>Despite her ability to articulate compelling views, she no longer believed that her voice mattered. After a “really hard summer of anxiety and depression,” she started playing music, which improved her life.</p><p>Since she could “turn the agony into something true and beautiful,” the AGT contestant became interested in songwriting. Her clear views on using music to spread medical awareness are highlighted in the biography section of her website. She claims:</p><p>“The challenges I encountered gave me the motivation to write songs on the state of the human predicament. Everyone experiences ups and downs, but music is such an effective driver for positive growth. When words fail, music speaks!</p><p>Since she started using Instagram in 2020, Amanda has gained over 3.4K followers. Her hit songs include Prove You Wrong, Worth The Waiting, and Larger Guy. She has also performed several cover songs. Her website, linked to her Instagram feed, is accessible to viewers.</p><p>America’s Got Talent (AGT) has been renewed for a record-breaking 17 years due to the outstanding performance of previous seasons. The program has showcased some excellent talent in a variety of creative fields this season, and there will be much more to come.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Samantha Stollenwerck</a></h3>Samantha Stollenwerck estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
